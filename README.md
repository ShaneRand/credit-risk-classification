Module 20 Challenge

*Overview*
     Use a dataset of historical lending activity from a peer-to-peer lending services company to build a model that can identify the creditworthiness of borrowers.

*Decription of accuracy, precision, and recall scores of the machine learning model*
    -Accuracy: overall accuracy of the model is 0.99, which means 99% of the total predictions were correct.
    
    -Precision: this is the meausre of accuracy of the positive predictions. For class 0 (healthy loans), the precision is 1.00, indicating that all predicted instances of class 0 were correct. For class 1 (high-risk loans), the precision is 0.84, meaning that 84% of the instances predicted as class 1 were actually class 1.

    -Recall scores: This measures the ability of the model to find all the relevant cases (true positives). For class 0 (healthy loans), the recall is 0.99, indicating that 99% of actual class 0 instances were correctly identified. For class 1 (high-risk loans), the recall is 0.94, meaning that 94% of actual class 1 instances were correctly identified.

*Summary*
    THis machine learning model is a good credit risk model for the company. It demonstrates a strong ability to identify both healthy loans and high-risk loans. The model's performance proves it can be trusted to make projections that are considered reliable which allows us to appropriately designate high-risk loans vs lower risk loans.
